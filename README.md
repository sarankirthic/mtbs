# Booking Management API

A RESTful backend service built using Java, designed to manage user authentication, booking processes, email notifications, password resets, and payment transactions. This project provides essential endpoints for handling common operations in booking-based applications such as hotel reservations, event management, or appointment scheduling.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- **Authentication** â€“ Handles user registration, login, and token-based authentication.
- **Booking Management** â€“ Allows users to create, view, and manage bookings.
- **Email Notifications** â€“ Sends confirmation and alert emails to users for various actions.
- **Password Reset** â€“ Provides endpoints to securely reset user passwords.
- **Payment Transactions** â€“ Processes payment-related operations and keeps track of transaction status.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or above
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management
- Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) configured for storing user and transaction data
- SMTP server credentials for email functionality
- Payment gateway API keys for processing payments

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking-management-api.git
   cd booking-management-api
   ```
2. Configure environment variables or application.properties with the database, SMTP, and payment gateway credentials.
3. Build the project
   ```bash
   ./mvnw package spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests
   ```
4. Run the application
   ```bash
   java -jar targer/*.jar > app.log
   ```
### API Endpoints

### âš™ Configuration

1. Add configurations for:
2. Database connection (e.g., URL, username, password)
3. SMTP server (host, port, credentials)
4. Payment gateway (API keys, callback URLs)

### ðŸ”’ Security

1. Passwords should be hashed using bcrypt or similar algorithms.
2. JWT or session-based authentication is recommended.
3. Validate inputs to prevent common attacks like SQL injection.

### ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements

1. Implement user roles and permissions
2. Add API rate limiting
3. Improve logging and monitoring
4. Support multi-language email templates
